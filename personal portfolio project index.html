	<h4>For those who does not know anything about soccer game, I am pleased to explain how it is the field.</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Goalkeeper: The goalkeeper is the player who stands in front of the goal post and defends it. The goalkeeper's role is to prevent the opposition team from scoring a goal.</li>
		<li>Defenders: Defenders are the players who play in the backline of the team's formation. Their primary role is to defend the goal post and prevent the opposition team from scoring. Defenders can be divided into center backs, fullbacks, and wingbacks, depending on their position in the formation.</li>
		<li>Midfielders: Midfielders play in the middle of the field and are responsible for controlling the game. They are often the players who create scoring opportunities for their team by passing the ball to the forwards. Midfielders can be divided into defensive midfielders, central midfielders, and attacking midfielders, depending on their position in the formation.</li>
		<li>Forwards: Forwards are the players who play at the front of the team's formation. Their primary role is to score goals for their team. Forwards can be divided into center forwards and wingers, depending on their position in the formation.</li>
		<p>Each position requires different skills and strengths, but all positions are important for the team's success. A well-balanced team will have players in each position who can work together effectively to win the game.</p>
